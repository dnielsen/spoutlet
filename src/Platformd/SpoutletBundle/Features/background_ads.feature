Feature: background ads display
    In order to know about interesting content
    As a visitor
    I need to be able to see /click a background ad

# Commented out until we implement javascript capable testing

#    Scenario: see background ad because good site and time
#        Given there is an already existing background ad at date "+2 days" - "+4 days" for site "Europe" with url "/non-existent-path"
#        And I am on the "Europe" site
#        And I am on "/games"
#        When I click background
#        Then I should be on "/age/verify"
