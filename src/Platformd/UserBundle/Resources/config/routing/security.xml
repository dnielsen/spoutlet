    Overridden to hack around the security framework. Basically, the i18n
    routing bundle prefixes all URLs with /cn and /jp. That's great, except
    that this doesn't really help for URLs like /login_check and /logout,
    where the security framework is listening on JUST those specific URLs.

    Fortunately, the routing bundle skips any routes whose names start with
    an underscore. So, to make life simpler, we'll prefix these routes with
    that.

    To make matters worse, the LogoutListener and HttpUtils classes muck
    things up after redirecting after logout. Instead just redirecting, the
    search to see if there is a route matching the current URL. If there
    is (and there of course is in our case), it grabs the locale from that
    route and makes it the current locale. This means that we *almost* don't
    care that we're sending a chinese user to /logout. But, since it sniffs
    out that URL and finds the I18n route with the english _locale, the user
    is sent into the wrong locale. This is solved by adding that underscore
    at the front of the URL
